# 2048

## Description

2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game where the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them, ultimately creating a tile with the number 2048. Players can move tiles in four directions - up, down, left, and right - and with each move, a new tile randomly appears on the board. The game ends when the player successfully creates a tile with the number 2048 or when the grid is full and no more moves can be made.

## Features

- **Simple Gameplay**: Easy to understand, yet challenging to master.
- **Addictive**: Engaging gameplay keeps players hooked for hours.
- **Scoring**: Points are earned with each tile combination, motivating players to aim for higher scores.
- **Endless Mode**: Continue playing even after reaching 2048, aiming for higher scores.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: Used for the game layout and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for game logic and interactivity.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Utilized to dynamically update the game board and handle user interactions.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move tiles in the respective direction.
2. Tiles with the same number merge when they collide, doubling their value.
3. Continue merging tiles and strategize to reach the 2048 tile.
4. The game ends when the 2048 tile is created, or there are no more valid moves.
